#### About Me
![Image](#)

My experience as a CISO involve many of the things that are crucial for OWASP right now: vision, budget, strategic planning, communication, marketing, project management, and policies. The current pandemic that has turned our world upside down is having a dramatic effect on OWASP, as our main source of revenue, in-person conferences, has taken a heavy blow. OWASP needs a leader who has the wealth of years addressing challenges not unlike what we are facing today. I have long said that we need to increase our marketing efforts to spread the word more about all the terrific work project leaders are doing, and secure more corporate funding to make us more self-sustaining.

I am currently serving on the OWASP Global Board of Directors. I have been the driving force in getting committees re-established, successfully getting the Outreach and Chapters committees officially going. Committees are crucial to OWASP, as The Global Board is a volunteer board, and thus incapable of handling everything that needs attention, and the management team is just too small. There just isn't enough money to hire more staff. We will just have to do it ourselves. 

I was adamant about OWASP making a public statement when violence rocked our world, affirming that we stand with members of our community and others worldwide in demanding equality for all humankind. There was debate within the current Board, and only 4 of us voted to make this important statement. I was one of the key authors, and fought hard against those who opposed it, such as my fellow board member who is running for re-election, to ensure its release. 

I have been a selfless and tireless volunteer for OWASP, helping to grow both the OWASP Los Angeles and Orange County chapters. I have been an instrumental force in uniting the information security community in the Southern California region. I have been involved in a multitude of projects and events, increasing awareness of OWASP and secure development and helping to grow membership. When I joined the OWASP LA Chapter, meetings were attracting 12-15 attendees. My marketing efforts and work with the vendor community to help sponsor meetings has driven attendance to 80-100 each month. There are currently 2,100 OWASP LA Meetup members. When the Orange County Chapter stopped meeting, Richard worked with the International Board and local volunteers in OC to reinvigorate the OC Chapter. It now meets monthly and has 1,200 Meetup members.

I was a Co-Chair of the highly successful AppSec USA in 2010 in Irvine, California, and has been Co-Chair of the highly acclaimed AppSec California from its inception in 2014 to the present, conferences that have provided possibly the best speaker line-ups anywhere.

I also speak at conferences and moderate panels on InfoSec and Secure Development, most recently at the ISACA conference and for EC-Council. I have worked with ISSA International to bring secure development talks into the general InfoSec community, including presentations to CISOs and at the ISSA International Conference.

If we are going to affect change and help to get companies to take seriously the release of secure software, we cannot continue to just "preach to the choir", but must reach all those who can have a say in company policies. Collaboration is the key, and I have always been a strong proponent of this.

#### How will you help active projects thrive and become more recognized and used by the software industry?
I like to think I have a wide vision, and have reached out far from just the Development community to indoctrinate many IT and InfoSec professionals in Southern California with the philosophy and beliefs of OWASP. As President of the Information Systems Security Association Los Angeles Chapter, I have been leveraging this position to ensure collaboration between these two leading SoCal organizations (OWASP and ISSA) for many years, resulting in a large increase of both awareness of OWASP projects and attendance at both organization's meetings. I have also organized joint meetings with CSA (the Cloud Security Alliance), ISACA, AITP, MESA, and HTCIA (High Technology Crime Investigation Association). Talking and meeting among ourselves is great, but we need visionaries who can look beyond our community and get better recognition for OWASP everywhere.

#### Please describe any previous experience you have had running or on the board of a large international non-profit.
I have been serving on the OWASP Global Board of Directors since January 2019. I was a member of the OWASP Global Conferences Committee, lending my years of experience in putting together successful conferences, from the perspective of quality of speakers, smoothness and professionalism of the events, and profit. I helped craft the OWASP Conference Project Plan that has been the bible for how to manage a successful conference. I have been the chapter leader for OWASP Los Angeles for almost eight years. During that time, I tripled monthly attendance, increased sponsorship revenue, brought in great world-class speakers, and started (with Neil Matatall) AppSec California, one of the most successful OWASP conferences in the world. AppSec Cali is a showcase of how to build and run a top-notch conference, with great content and networking, a sizable profit, and a fun and rewarding experience for all attendees. 

#### What, if any, aspects do you think would need improving regarding OWASP membership?
I have been the leading voice on the current OWASP Board to grant complimentary membership to chapter and project leaders. These volunteers are the pillars of our community, the essence of OWASP, and the misguided attempts to squeeze money from these people who are giving so much already has to stop. I have also been pushing for honorary membership for those that have been volunteering for many years at a high level of time and energy expended. It is time we recognize the efforts that these people have put in to the organization. Membership has not been marketed very effectively, nor managed well since I have been involved with OWASP. A single source of truth needs to be built that is kept current where membership status is kept and that can automatically send notifications to members whose membership renewals are coming due. We need a membership drive that reaches out not just to the community, but also outside of it, to other organizations and to companies worldwide. Where is our voice on LinkedIn and Twitter? 

#### What is your plan for increasing women and minority participation in OWASP?
I am an avid supporter and believer in a more diverse InfoSec and Development workforce. Finding skilled people in these fields is hard enough, and it will get worse soon. Women and minorities need a welcoming and supportive environment and OWASP must take an active role in creating vehicles to support this. We need to ensure all of our events worldwide operate under a zero-tolerance policy. We need to extend what I have been doing at AppSec California, which is offering Diversity Scholarships to allow diverse groups to get attendance and travel sponsored at this wonderful event. I created the Women in Security Forum, a two-day amazing event as a part of the ISSA-LA Security Summit. Every time slot for the two days featured at least one woman speaker, on both technical and management topics. I would like to see OWASP offer this, as well, and will help make this a reality.

#### How will you help OWASP to provide an even better user experience to our target audience via our websites and GitHub organization?
I don't know about you, but technical people, including developers, are not the best people to ensure a good user experience. Think of all the software we use, and so many websites, where we have to hunt around to find content and to access features. OWASP recently migrated to a new website, but we still need to improve many things with this new site. Remember, it is not just a site for us to use, but is the face of OWASP to the world. And Github? How do we find everything that has been posted? Even at our current Board meetings, when I mention that a subject has much content on Github, I hear, "how do I find it?" This needs to be improved. I will continue to offer my guidance on this important issue.

#### What kind of specific partnerships would be beneficial for improving OWASP recognition and collaboration with the broader security community?
AS I mentioned above, I have been collaborating and building partnerships for many years with other not-for-profit organizations. But i also have created many co-marketing agreements with many conferences to allow us to have an OWASP booth, and to speak about OWASP. For many of these opportunities, it was the first time many of the attendees have heard of OWASP. This type of outreach is crucial for our mission, as we need to reach not just developers and InfoSec professionals, but business executives at companies, heads of IT, and risk professionals. I have presented to them and also engaged with them during breakout sessions and through networking gatherings from these conferences. We too often see that our OWASP community spends the majority of our time with each other, basically preaching to the choir. We need to broaden our vision.
