I believe that OWASP is about community! Since my first encounter with OWASP at the AppSec conference in Leuven, Belgium, back in 2006, I have been actively contributed to OWASP in various ways. I have and continue to work to introduce OWASP to professionals, students, and developers. 
Here are a few of my engagements years:

- I am co-chair of the annual OWASP BeNeLux-Day
- I was co-organizer of the Summit in 2011
- I have been involved in every AppSec-Eu since 2011
  - I hosted several Capture the Flag events at various AppSec conferences in Europe and USA.
  - I introduced the University Challenges at the AppSec conferences in Europe
  - Chair of the AppSec-Eu 2015 in Amsterdam
  - Co-Chair of the training selection committee of the AppSec-Eu 2016 in Rome

- I served as comliance officer for the OWASP Foundation ins 2014 and 2015.
- Member of the OWASP Board of directors since 2016, chairman of the board in 2018 and 2019.

Next to my responsibilities as member of the BoD, I focus on developer outreach, the OWASP Security Knowledge Framework (SKF) project and supporting new chapters. I also work to connect leaders so they can collaborate on the best practices and improve the quality on the OWASP projects. Outside of OWASP, I support IAMTHECAVALRY, have been involved in working groups for the European Commission as FOSSA, AITOI and the Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM)
