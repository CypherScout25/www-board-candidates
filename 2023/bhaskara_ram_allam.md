#### Do you believe all OWASP Board discussions should happen in the open (excluding HR, Compliance, etc.)?

The question of whether all OWASP Board discussions should happen in the open is a nuanced one and involves balancing transparency with the need for confidentiality in certain matters. Here is a perspective:

**Transparency Benefits:**
1. **Community Trust:** Open discussions promote transparency, building trust within the OWASP community by allowing members to observe and understand decision-making processes.
2. **Engagement:** Open discussions encourage community engagement, enabling members to provide valuable input and feedback on important matters.
3. **Accountability:** Transparency holds the board accountable to its stakeholders, demonstrating a commitment to openness and inclusivity.

**Confidentiality Considerations:**
1. **Sensitive Issues:** Certain discussions, such as those related to HR, legal matters, or compliance, may involve sensitive information that must be handled confidentially to protect individuals and the organization.
2. **Effective Decision-Making:** Confidentiality allows for more candid and effective discussions on certain matters, fostering an environment where board members can freely express opinions without fear of immediate public scrutiny.

**Balancing Approach:**
1. **Selective Transparency:** Consider a selective approach, where discussions on most matters are open, but the board retains the ability to move into closed sessions for specific topics that require confidentiality.
2. **Clear Policies:** Establish clear policies outlining the criteria for closed sessions, ensuring that such decisions are made judiciously and in the best interests of OWASP.
3. **Communication:** Communicate the reasons for closed sessions to the community, demonstrating that confidentiality is invoked responsibly and with due consideration for the organization's well-being.

Ultimately, finding the right balance between openness and confidentiality is essential. OWASP can benefit from transparent governance while recognizing the need to handle certain matters with discretion to protect the organization and its members. The key is to establish clear guidelines and foster a culture of accountability and responsibility within the board.


#### What are you plans to have the board and staff be more involved in project marketing/cheerleading?

To increase the involvement of the board and staff in project marketing and cheerleading, a proactive and collaborative approach can be implemented. Here are some plans:

1. **Establish a Marketing Task Force:**
   - Form a dedicated marketing task force comprising board members, staff, and enthusiastic community volunteers.
   - Define clear roles and responsibilities for the task force to ensure effective collaboration and coordination.
