### About Me
![Paulino Calderon](/www-board-candidates/assets/images/paulino-calderon.jpg)

I'm thrilled to announce my candidacy for a position on the OWASP board. For those who might not know me personally, let me share a bit about my journey in cybersecurity.

Over the years, I've had the honor of co-founding cybersecurity companies such as [Websec Mexico](https://websec.mx/), [Websec Canada](https://websec.ca/), and [PWNLab](http://pwnlab.mx/). More than just establishing them, I played a hands-on role in guiding these companies, directly contributing to their growth. I've also had the privilege of contributing to several impactful projects. One of the non-OWASP projects close to my heart is ['nmap'](/www-board-candidates/assets/images/paulino-calderon_nmap.jpg), a tool that's instrumental to many in our industry where I've not only contributed but also mentored talents through the Google Summer of Code program. On top of that, I've actively been at the forefront of organizing events, including the OWASP LATAM Tour in México ([2018](https://youtu.be/2ZpvVAzjHYY?si=s4WVqHdTP0Xb6B9u), [2019](https://youtu.be/LDQyjAhumOo?si=GDoUtolvN58hxo8A), [2020](https://youtube.com/shorts/Jxr2zQrGdUc?si=ZFhWG4v_ekW5RHcb)). It's always been a rewarding experience to see our community come together, exchange knowledge, and drive forward our collective mission.

Within the OWASP community, I've been deeply involved as a [chapter leader](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-riviera-maya/), [project leader](https://github.com/OWASP/IoTGoat), and occasional contributor to [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/assets/images/posts/juice-shop-v10/summit2.jpg) and [OWASP MSTG/MASVS](/www-board-candidates/assets/images/paulino-calderon_mstg.jpg). I've been fortunate to work with some of the brightest minds here, sharing, learning, and evolving. This enriching journey with OWASP fuels my desire to serve more.

Joining the OWASP board isn't just a title or role for me. It's about living out our values, working together to make the online world safer, and helping OWASP grow into a go-to place for software security. I'm passionate about ensuring everyone gets heard and has a fair shot at creating awesome, game-changing projects.

I humbly seek your support and promise to be a voice for progress, collaboration, and innovation. Let’s shape the future of OWASP together, leveraging our combined expertise and passion.
