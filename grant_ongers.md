#### About Me
![Grant Ongers](https://www.securedelivery.io/images/team/go.jpg);

Grant's experience spans Dev - building platforms for regulated industries for more than 10 years. 20+ years in Ops, everything from managing operations in NOCs to mainframe and DBs. He also has over 30 years pushing the limits of (Info)Sec - mostly white-hat.

Grantâ€™s community involvement is global: Staff at BSides (London, Las Vegas, and Cape Town), Goon at DEF CON (USA) for nearly ten years and DC2721 co-founder, staff at BlackHat (USA and EU), and current OWASP Global Board member (hoping to complete the work he's begun there).

#### OWASP has great resources for different people and different roles: CISOs, AppSec Managers, Pentesters, Analysts, Developers, DevOps, QA, and even users. Currently, most of them are either not aware of OWASP, or consider OWASP as a short for the "OWASP Top 10". What practical steps should OWASP take to change that?
```We have already started reaching out to developers, through activities like the Developer Summit and through the Outreach Committee. After all, they are in the best place to affect application security in a meaningful way. That work neeeds to continue. We also need to bring OWASP beyond the Top 10 and into the board rooms, and onto the red and blue team's radars. I will continue that work though the connections I have with DEF CON and BlackHat, and through the work that both the Education and Outreach Comittees are doing with our corporate supporters.```

#### Sometimes local chapters disband before anyone knows they exist and there does not seem to be a strong mechanism to regrow them. How will you enable members to grow OWASP in their localities?
```This is one of the hard problems to solve. On the one hand we want chapters to be self sufficient and to grown and fill their seats themselves, on the other we want to give them every oppertunity to do that. We do need to provide them with support and I hope that the Chapters Committee will be able to lead the charge here. On a more personal note I am working to ensure that the chapters I know that have gone through this are getting reborn, Cape Town and Abu Dhabi for example. The latter of which I'm speaking at the relaunch of soon - despite it being far to early on a Saturday morning :-)```

#### What experience do you bring serving in a board or executive committee of a large international organization or project?
```I have served two years on the OWASP Board - through, arguably the hardest time for organisations like ours. The last year I have served as the Treasurer and have had to find ways to ensure that the Foundation says afloat through it all. It looks like we will actually end this yar in a better position than we budgeted for and with a better chance to start next year off right.```

#### COVID-19 has had a major impact on OWASP's major earning sources which were conference tickets / training tickets. What will you do to ensure more balanced funding sources in the future?
```This is something that I have spend the entirity of this year working on. The broad plan is that each of the budget areas will become self-funding. And that the areas that do better than anticipated can provide support to those that don't do as well. A big part of that will be the grant's process which will allow projects and comittees to aquire direct funding for efforts in their areas, I hope to trail the first full cycle of that soon with the Education Committee.```

```Of course there are many other areas where we need to work on, to start with we need to get more corporations that leverage the outputs of the Foundation to contribute meaningfully to the running of the organisation, and we need to increase out member base as well (by getting more developers onboard - they do outnumber us 100 to 1).```

#### What are the three main things you'd focus on changing/improving for OWASP as an organization, and why?
```
Mostly the two points mentioned above:
- Get developers to join us as members; and
- Get more coprorate sponsors contributing directly to projects through grants
```

```The reasons should be self explainitory: more members means we will have more membership revunue - but more importantly we will be bringing our mission to more people and to people more able to make an impact on code quality. And corporations that leverage OWASP should (and for the most part want to) contribute back. Let's help them do so.```

#### Automation and now AI have been good for AppSec in that it has increased the speed of releases, improved detection of coding flaws and reduced overall operating costs. At the same time, jobs in AppSec are moving from analyst positions to lower paid engineering positions. What do you see as being OWASP's role in the industry in ten years and how would you begin to position OWASP to get there?
```OWASP should be talking to the engineers, we should be an organisation of engineers and for engineers. The work described earlier will help us position ourselves as the place for developers to go for knowledge, frameworks, and tools to ensure security quality of their code is at the right level.```
