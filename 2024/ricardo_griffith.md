### About Me
![Ricardo Griffith - Copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cfd54a8-7909-45ff-b214-8bed92d0e20d)

With 25 years of experience in application development, I have honed my skills across a variety of roles, specializing in creating innovative solutions for the finance and insurance sectors. I currently serve as a Technical Solution Architect for a leading insurance company in Bermuda and am the co-founder of a software company, where I drive the development of cutting-edge technology products.

I hold a B.S. in Computer Science/Engineering from Johnson C. Smith University and an MBA from South University. In addition to several industry technical certifications, I am working towards a graduate certificate in Information Systems from Boston University, which I will complete by the end of the year.

Passionate about continuous learning and advancing the field of technology, I actively engage in both professional development and community initiatives. In my personal time, I enjoy spending time with my family—my spouse, two kids, and our King Charles dog—gaming, and relaxing at the beach.
