### About Me

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80b798e4-ba03-4f3e-992f-12341da6a5f4)

With over 25 years of industry experience in application development, I have honed my skills across a variety of roles, specializing in creating innovative solutions for the finance and insurance sectors. Currently, I serve as a Technical Solution Architect for a leading insurance company in Bermuda. As a co-founder of a software company, I also drive the development of cutting-edge consumer technology experiences.

**I am a lifelong learner**, continually enriching my mind with knowledge and staying abreast of the latest developments in technology. Throughout my career, I have pursued various educational opportunities—from foundational studies in electronics to advanced coursework in information systems. Alongside earning multiple industry certifications, I remain committed to expanding my expertise and adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape. My journey reflects a deep-seated passion for personal and professional growth, driving me to constantly seek new insights and understanding.

Passionate about advancing the field of technology and aligning with OWASP's mission to improve software security, I believe in the power of open collaboration and knowledge sharing to foster innovation and enhance security practices globally. My commitment to ethical development and integrity reflects OWASP's core values, and **I strive to make a positive impact on the developer community**.

Outside of my professional endeavors, **I enjoy spending quality time with my family—my spouse, two kids, and our dog**. I find _balance_ through gaming, learning new coding methods and programming languages, and relaxing at the beach—activities that recharge me and nurture my passion for continuous learning.

In alignment with the ongoing conversations about modernizing OWASP and refocusing on our core values, if elected, I dedicate implementing focused strategic initiatives that will propel the OWASP Foundation forward. Below, I outline how I intend to address these key areas:

#### Highlighting a Shared Vision
In recent times, there has been a growing conversation within OWASP about the need for modernization and a refocusing on our core values. _I fully acknowledge and embrace this dialogue_. My platform aligns with this movement to enhance OWASP's relevance and effectiveness and I am **committed to driving strategic initiatives** that bring us back to our foundational mission and help address security challenges faced by developers today. By **uniting our efforts**, we can ensure OWASP remains a pivotal resource in the ever-evolving landscape of application security.

#### Emphasizing Practical Solutions for Developers
I am deeply committed to empowering developers with the **tools**, **education**, and **certifications**, they will need to code more securely. Recognizing the demand for practical resources highlighted by past OWASP leaders, I propose to double down on our educational offerings. This includes expanding our training programs and forging certification pathways to reflect current industry needs. By aligning our efforts with the real-world needs of developers, we can bridge the gap between security principles and practical application, fostering a more secure software development ecosystem.

#### Advocating for Strategic Initiatives
To maximize our impact, I advocate for strategic initiatives that streamline OWASP's projects and enhance coordination. I believe we should conduct a thorough review of our current projects to identify those that most effectively serve our mission and the developer community. By focusing our resources on these key initiatives, we can prevent the dilution of efforts and ensure we deliver maximum value to our community. This strategic emphasis will not only elevate the quality of our offerings but also reinforce OWASP's role as a foundational pillar in the application security landscape.

#### Promoting Community and Collaboration
Engaging with the developer community is crucial for fostering innovation and participation. I propose that OWASP actively participate in major developer conferences throughout the next year. Our presence at these events will increase membership, forge new organizational partnerships, and enhance our visibility. Additionally, I advocate for expanding our outreach programs and local chapter activities to create more opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing. By fostering a collaborative environment, we encourage community members to contribute their unique perspectives and expertise, enriching the OWASP community as a whole.

#### Addressing Governance and Diversity
To adapt to the rapidly changing field of application security, we must cultivate a governance structure that is both inclusive and dynamic. I propose introducing non-elected board members to diversify leadership and bring in fresh perspectives. This step will help reduce bureaucracy and inject new ideas and expertise into our decision-making processes. By diversifying our leadership, we can better address the complex challenges facing our organization and create a more responsive and agile OWASP that is equipped to lead in the modern landscape.

## Questions

### What unique strategic goal do you intend to bring on board, if you are elected?
My unique strategic goal is to embrace developers where they are by extending OWASP's presence at global developer conferences. I believe that to effectively promote application security (AppSec), **we need to engage directly with the developer community in their own spaces**. By setting up OWASP booths, workshops, and presentations at some of the largest developer conferences next year and beyond, we can increase our visibility, foster collaboration, and provide valuable resources directly to those who build software. This outreach will help us connect with developers worldwide, encourage the adoption of secure coding practices, and reinforce OWASP's role as a leader in addressing the most pressing security challenges faced by the developer community today.
