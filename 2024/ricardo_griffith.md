### About Me
![Ricardo Griffith - Copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cfd54a8-7909-45ff-b214-8bed92d0e20d)

With 25 years of stockpiling industry knowledge and experience in application development, I have honed my skills across a variety of roles, specializing in creating innovative solutions for the finance and insurance sectors. I currently am in a Technical Solution Architect role for a leading insurance company in Bermuda and a co-founder of a software company, where I drive the development of a consumer technology-based experience.

I am a life-long learner, continually enrichingmy mind with all things in technology.  My post-high school education includes a Certificate in Electronics from Bermuda College, B.S. in Computer Science/Engineering from Johnson C. Smith University and an MBA from South University. In addition to several industry certifications, my educational journey continues with  a Graduate Certificate in Information Systems from Boston University, which I expect to complete by the end of the year.

Passionate about advancing the field of technology and aligning with OWASP's mission to improve software security, I actively engage in professional development and community initiatives. I believe in the power of open collaboration and knowledge sharing to foster innovation and enhance security practices globally. My commitment to ethical development and integrity reflects OWASP's core values, as I strive to make a positive impact on the developer community.

Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy spending quality time with my family—my spouse, two kids, and our King Charles dog. I find balance through gaming and relaxing at the beach, activities that recharge me and reinforce my dedication to creating a safer digital world for future generations.

## Questions

### What unique strategic goal do you intend to bring on board, if you are elected?
My strategic goal for the next term is to bring OWASP back to its core roots—Application Security (AppSec). While OWASP has matured over the years, our primary mission has always been to secure software. I aim to strengthen our influence by focusing our stategy on building comprehensive standards and educational tools specifically targeted at AppSec. By emphasizing best practices in secure development, OWASP can continue to be a leader in addressing the most pressing security challenges faced by developers today.

### What is your vision for OWASP over the next three to five years?
In the next three to five years, I envision OWASP doubling down on education and certification, with a heavy focus on application security. Two compelling reasons for this are (click to expand each section):

The application layer is where most security vulnerabilities arise. By providing thorough, accessible education and certification programs, we can directly impact developers’ ability to write secure code and prevent vulnerabilities before they happen.

<summary><strong>Building Trust Through Certification</strong></summary>

 As organizations increasingly look for verified security credentials, OWASP certifications in AppSec can help establish a new standard for professionals in the field. By focusing on AppSec certifications, we can ensure that the community is equipped with the right skills to meet the evolving security challenges.

### What contributions have you personally made to OWASP or other open source projects?
As the current Director on the OWASP board, I have worked to align the organization’s strategic direction with its mission to improve the security of software. In my capacity as a member of the Compliance Committee, I’ve been actively involved in establishing best practices and ensuring compliance with industry standards. Furthermore, I have consistently contributed to community discussions and policy development to foster transparency and inclusivity within the organization.

### What strategies would you implement to increase community engagement and participation in OWASP?
To increase engagement, my priority would be to make OWASP more visible at every developer-focused event next year, with a specific emphasis on AppSec conferences. Being present at these events will allow us to directly engage with the community, recruit new members, and collaborate with organizations that share our mission. Furthermore, I would push to offer more hands-on workshops, code labs, and real-world AppSec challenges, making it easier for developers to engage with OWASP tools and projects in practical settings.

### What will be your efforts to ensure OWASP continues to be a centerpiece in software security?
OWASP’s continued relevance depends on its ability to stay ahead of the curve. My focus will be on ensuring that we are continuously updating our resources and tools to address the most current security challenges. I will also prioritize collaboration with industry and academia to identify and respond to new threats. Furthermore, I will champion outreach programs that emphasize education, especially targeting the next generation of developers and security professionals.

### What should OWASP stop doing and why?
OWASP should reconsider initiatives that stray too far from its core focus on AppSec. While branching out into other areas of security is important, we must not dilute our primary mission. By concentrating on what we do best—securing applications and educating developers on AppSec—we can have a greater, more focused impact. Additionally, the OWASP Board should embrace change by incorporating non-elected board members. Bringing in individuals with specialized AppSec expertise will ensure we maintain a high standard and remain rooted in our foundational mission.
