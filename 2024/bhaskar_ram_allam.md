### Questions & Answers

#### What unique strategic goal do you intend to bring on board if you are elected?  
If elected, my strategic goal is to **enhance OWASP's presence in emerging technologies like blockchain and AI security**. By integrating security standards for decentralized technologies and artificial intelligence, OWASP can play a pivotal role in shaping the future of secure software development across a wide range of applications. I aim to bridge the gap between traditional software security and new tech landscapes.

#### What is your vision for OWASP over the next three to five years?  
My vision for OWASP is to **lead the global conversation on security for emerging technologies** like blockchain, decentralized networks, and artificial intelligence. In the next three to five years, I see OWASP creating more comprehensive security frameworks for these technologies while further expanding its global footprint, ensuring its relevance in new industries while continuing to serve its core mission of software security.

#### What contributions have you personally made to OWASP or other open-source projects?  
I have been actively contributing to open-source projects, including **NumPy 2.0.0**, and I am involved in **Hyperledger Cacti** on GitHub. My company, **Kerdos Infrasoft**, actively collaborates with Kerdos, Filecoin, Ethereum on enhancing security solutions and developing innovative approaches to blockchain technology and AI. Additionally, I have supported educational efforts through **SecretCoder.org**, promoting secure coding practices for developers worldwide.

#### What strategies would you implement to increase community engagement and participation in OWASP?  
I believe in **active mentorship programs and industry partnerships** to foster community engagement. My strategy would involve expanding OWASP's reach by collaborating with educational platforms like SecretCoder.org and increasing local chapter visibility through online courses and interactive learning experiences. Additionally, I would work on **sponsorships and hackathons** to attract new contributors from academia and the tech industry.

#### What will be your efforts to ensure OWASP continues to be a centerpiece in software security?  
To ensure OWASP's continued leadership, I will focus on **collaborating with major tech organizations and security communities** to keep OWASP standards ahead of the curve. I will also emphasize the importance of **security for blockchain and AI technologies**, creating dedicated task forces to develop and implement security frameworks for these emerging fields.

#### What should OWASP stop doing and why?  
While OWASP is renowned for its broad range of projects, I believe it should **prioritize quality over quantity** in its initiatives. Some less impactful projects should either be consolidated or retired, allowing OWASP to concentrate its efforts on high-impact areas like cloud security, AI, and decentralized applications. This would ensure that OWASP continues to deliver value and remains relevant in a fast-changing technological landscape.
