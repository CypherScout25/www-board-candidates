# www-board-candidates

* Update bios and answer questions that are in the personal markdown files.
* Images can be uploaded to [/assets/images/](https://github.com/OWASP/www-board-candidates/tree/master/assets/images). You will see a button in the upper right hand corner that says Add file.... The image can then be linked inside bio with:
    ```
    ![Name](/www-board-candidates/assets/images/image.png)
    ```
* Videos should exist on a different platform (Twitch, YouTube, etc) and linked to from there.
* Another excellent resource on [Github Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
