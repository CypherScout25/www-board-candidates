#### How do you intend to extend outreach to developers and developer communities outside of the security ecosystem?

```

We can coordinate with some developer clubs to conduct more application security events. we can engage with those clubs and interact with the developers to make them aware of OWASP.

```

#### What practical experience can you bring to the specific challenges a nonprofit organization like OWASP faces such as fundraising, staff support, operating model/by-laws, etc?

```

Since I have been serving OWASP for 2 years, To my knowledge, it's time to spread awareness. Although it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd, with a little creativity, we can make your voice heard. Let people know about us by getting them to talk about us. Word-of-mouth is one of the primary methods by which brands attract and retain audiences. A recommendation from a friend, colleague, or family member can make all the difference. The best place to begin is on social media. You can use social media to connect with donors and organizations, as well as voice your opinion on community issues.

```

#### How do you plan to become less dependent on the primary revenue stream of “Offline Conferences”?

```

In order to be less dependent on offline conference revenue, we need to find another way to generate revenue. It would be beneficial if we focused more on corporate memberships and had our own merchandise. As a way to welcome low-level startups to OWASP, we should give them some kind of acknowledgment or small goodies.

```

#### Where do you see the biggest challenges for OWASP as a volunteer-driven organization in 2023+ and how do you intend to address them?

```

Currently, there is no basic requirement for OWASP Chapter. It is important to follow a standard when applying to a chapter, regardless of whether it is a student or local chapter. Each chapter must be verified individually during onboarding.  It would be great if we could verify our current chapters too. The current leaders aren't even familiar with OWASP or how the chapter works (mostly on the south side of India, not sure about the others). Most of them are unaware that we have a chapter handbook and resources where we can view a list of volunteer speakers. In terms of collaboration agreements and approaching a speaker, the organizers don't know how to proceed. Therefore, most chapters are run only by organizers who want to add OWASP to their resumes. Each chapter must be filtered to ensure at least one or two members understand how OWASP works. We need to set standards so that they have to contribute to OWASP projects/write blogs or anything like that as a qualification to join OWASP. 

```

#### What do you think will help to increase the adoption of the OWASP Projects?

```

As a chapter leader, I encourage members to build tools or develop resources for OWASP. Each chapter can follow the same procedure, and they can contribute to projects. A leader must participate in at least one project during a two- or three-year period.
